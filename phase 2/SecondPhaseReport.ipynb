    "# Data Structures Project: Phase 2 Report\n",
    "**Topic:** Memory-Efficient String Matching via Compressed Suffix Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "In Phase 2, the challenge shifted from simple pattern matching to handling large-scale data ($10^5$ characters) under strict memory constraints. The betrayal by \"Mr. Sir\" necessitated a transition from the memory-heavy **Suffix Trie** to a **Compressed Suffix Tree** built using **Suffix Arrays** and **LCP Arrays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Technical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Suffix Array Construction ($O(n \\log n)$)\n",
    "The foundation of the solution is the `GenerateSuffixArray` method. It implements the **Prefix Doubling** algorithm.\n",
    "* **Sort & Classify:** Initially, single characters are sorted.\n",
    "* **Refinement:** The algorithm iteratively sorts substrings of length $2, 4, 8, \\dots, 2^k$ by using the rank (equivalence class) of the two constituent halves from the previous iteration.\n",
    "* **Benefit:** This avoids the $O(n^2)$ complexity of naive suffix sorting, allowing us to handle the $10^5$ text length requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Longest Common Prefix (LCP) Array\n",
    "I implemented **Kasai’s Algorithm** in the `ComputeLCP` method. \n",
    "* By inverting the Suffix Array, we can calculate the LCP between lexicographically adjacent suffixes in linear time ($O(n)$).\n",
    "* The LCP array is the \"bridge\" that allows us to convert the flat Suffix Array into a hierarchical Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Compressed Suffix Tree Building\n",
    "Using the Suffix Array and LCP array, the `BuildTree` method constructs a **Compressed Suffix Tree**.\n",
    "* **Edge Compression:** Unlike a standard Trie, this structure collapses paths with only one child into a single edge containing multiple characters.\n",
    "* **Splitting Logic:** When the LCP between the previous and current suffix is less than the current node's depth, the algorithm \"climbs\" up the tree and splits an edge to create a new internal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Pattern Search and Retrieval\n",
    "The `SearchPattern` logic utilizes the tree’s structure for high-speed queries:\n",
    "1. **Traverse:** It matches the pattern against edge labels. Because edges are compressed, it can skip multiple characters in a single step.\n",
    "2. **Collect:** Once the pattern is fully matched at a specific node or edge, the algorithm performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) via `CollectLeaves` to gather all starting positions (indices) stored in the subtree's leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Performance Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Phase 1 (Suffix Trie) | Phase 2 (Suffix Tree) |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Preprocessing Complexity** | $O(n^2)$ | **$O(n \\log n)$** |\n",
    "| **Space Complexity** | $O(n^2)$ | **$O(n)$** |\n",
    "| **Search Time** | $O(m)$ | **$O(m + K)$** |\n",
    "| **Large Data Handling** | Fails on $10^5$ | **Optimized for $10^5$** |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: $n$ = Text length, $m$ = Pattern length, $K$ = Number of occurrences.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "Phase 2 successfully replaced the resource-intensive Suffix Trie with a sophisticated **Compressed Suffix Tree**. By combining the $O(n \\log n)$ sorting of the Suffix Array with the $O(n)$ LCP computation, the system can now perform near-instantaneous searches on massive datasets, allowing Kia and Saloos to bypass the final security gate."

    "# Data Structures Project: Phase 1 Report\n",
    "**Authors:** Kia & Saloos (Computer Engineering Students)  \n",
    "**Topic:** String Matching & Advanced Tree Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "This phase of the project involves two distinct string-processing challenges. The goal is to assist two students in bypassing a university security system by implementing efficient pattern-matching algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into:\n",
    "1.  **The \"Hercules\" Challenge:** General pattern searching using Rabin-Karp.\n",
    "2.  **The \"La Casa de Shamdun\" Challenge:** High-speed pattern retrieval using a Suffix Trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Section 1.1: The \"Hercules\" Challenge\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Identify the starting indices of several substrings within a provided text to prove student status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation: Rabin-Karp Algorithm\n",
    "For this task, I implemented the **Rabin-Karp algorithm**. This algorithm is highly efficient for searching multiple patterns because it uses a \"Rolling Hash\" technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hash Function:** Utilizes a base ($256$) and a prime modulus ($101$) to map strings to integer values.\n",
    "* **Rolling Hash Logic:** Instead of recomputing the hash for every window, the algorithm subtracts the high-order contribution of the old character and adds the new character in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "* **Collision Handling:** Since different strings can have the same hash (spurious hits), the code performs a literal string comparison (`text.Substring == pattern`) only when hashes match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:**\n",
    "* **Time:** Average $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is text length and $m$ is pattern length.\n",
    "* **Space:** $O(1)$ auxiliary space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Section 1.2: \"La Casa de Shamdun\"\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The \"Treasury\" password system requires finding occurrences of patterns within a very short timeframe. This necessitated a more robust preprocessing approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation: Suffix Trie\n",
    "I implemented a **Suffix Trie**, a specialized tree that represents all suffixes of a given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trie Construction:** Every suffix of the main text (from `text[i...end]`) is inserted into the Trie.\n",
    "* **Index Storage:** Each node in the Trie maintains a `List<int> Indices`, which stores the starting positions of all suffixes that pass through that specific prefix path.\n",
    "* **Fast Retrieval:** Once the Trie is built, searching for a pattern of length $m$ takes exactly $O(m)$ time, regardless of how large the main text is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:**\n",
    "* **Preprocessing:** $O(n^2)$ for the current implementation (building all suffixes).\n",
    "* **Search:** $O(m)$ per pattern.\n",
    "* **Space:** $O(n^2)$ worst-case for the Trie nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Algorithmic Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Rabin-Karp | Suffix Trie |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Strategy** | Hashing / Sliding Window | Preprocessed Tree Structure |\n",
    "| **Preprocessing Time** | $O(m)$ | $O(n^2)$ |\n",
    "| **Search Time** | $O(n)$ | $O(m)$ |\n",
    "| **Best For** | One-off searches | Multiple queries on static text |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "Both algorithms were successfully implemented in C#. The **Rabin-Karp** approach provided a lightweight solution for the first gate, while the **Suffix Trie** provided the near-instantaneous search capability required to bypass the treasury's time-sensitive lock."
